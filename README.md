# üé≠ Emoji Recommendation System via FaceMesh

## üìå Overview
This project is an **AI-powered emoji recommendation system** that detects a user's facial emotions in real time using **MediaPipe FaceMesh** and **CNN-based emotion classification models**. Based on detected emotions, the system dynamically suggests relevant emojis.

## üöÄ Features
- **Real-time facial emotion detection** using **MediaPipe FaceMesh**.
- **CNN-based classification** for recognizing emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.).
- **Emoji recommendations** based on detected emotions.
- **User-friendly UI** for displaying detected emotions and suggested emojis.
- **Optimized for real-time processing** with low latency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python** (OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras)
- **MediaPipe FaceMesh** (for facial landmark detection)
- **Flask** (for backend API)
- **JavaScript, HTML/CSS** (for frontend UI)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for training the emotion classification model)
